## 🚫 What NOT to Build (Yet)

### ❌ Skip These (Too Complex, Low ROI)
- ~~Full accounting system~~ (most shops have QuickBooks)
- ~~Inventory management~~ (most use spreadsheets, it's fine)
- ~~Employee payroll~~ (use Gusto/ADP, don't reinvent)
- ~~Complex marketing automation~~ (workflows handle this)
- ~~Fleet management~~ (only 10% of shops need it)
- ~~Multi-language~~ (95% of shops are English-only)

**Why Skip**: Each adds 10+ hours dev time for <5% of users

### ✅ Keep Simple Instead
- Integrate with QuickBooks (don't build accounting)
- Link to Google Calendar (don't build complex scheduling)
- Integrate with Gusto (don't build payroll)

**Philosophy**: Be the BEST estimating software, not mediocre everything-software!

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Philosophy

### Keep It SIMPLE
- ✅ Max 5-7 menu items
- ✅ Most-used features on dashboard
- ✅ Advanced features hidden in settings
- ✅ Clean, uncluttered design
- ✅ Helpful tooltips, not overwhelming

### Current Menu (PERFECT)
```
Dashboard
├─ Estimates (main tool)
├─ Customers
├─ Analytics (AI insights)
├─ Workflows (automation)
├─ Photos (with markup)
├─ Settings
└─ Help
```

**That's it! No 30-item menus like competitors!**
