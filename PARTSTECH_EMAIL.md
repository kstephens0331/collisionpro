# PartsTech Partnership Email - Short Version

**Subject:** Enterprise Collision Platform Seeking API Partnership - 20K+ Shop Market

---

Hi PartsTech Team,

I'm building **CollisionPro**, a next-generation collision estimating platform designed to compete with Mitchell International and CCC ONE. I'm reaching out to explore an API integration partnership.

## **The Opportunity**

CollisionPro's core innovation is a **Smart Cart Optimizer** that automatically finds the lowest-cost parts configuration across all available suppliers while optimizing for shipping costs. We need real-time access to your 20,000+ supplier network to make this work.

**Example:**
```
7 parts needed for repair
Traditional approach: $847 from one supplier
Smart Optimizer: $837 split across 3 suppliers
Savings: $10+ per repair × 50 repairs/month = $500+/month per shop
```

## **Why This Matters**

**Current Market:**
- Mitchell/CCC: 10-15 suppliers each
- CollisionPro (with PartsTech): 20,000+ suppliers

We're bringing PartsTech's supplier network to **5,000+ independent collision shops** who don't currently use your platform, creating new API revenue and transaction volume for your network.

## **Technical Details**

**Our Platform:**
- Next.js 16 / TypeScript / PostgreSQL (Production-ready)
- Multi-tenant SaaS architecture
- Smart optimization algorithm (built & tested)
- Real-time pricing UI with 10-second auto-refresh
- Deployed: collisionpro.vercel.app

**What We Need:**
- Parts search API (by year/make/model/category)
- Real-time pricing & inventory
- Supplier information (shipping rules, location)
- NEW parts only (condition filter critical)

**Expected Usage:**
- Month 1: 10K requests
- Month 6: 250K requests
- Year 1: 1M+ requests

## **The Ask**

I'd love a 30-minute call to discuss:

1. **API Access** - Beta/startup tier credentials
2. **Partnership Model** - Pricing, revenue share, co-marketing
3. **Integration Timeline** - 2-week integration, beta in 4 weeks

**Why Partner with CollisionPro:**
- ✅ New distribution channel (5K+ shops not using PartsTech)
- ✅ Modern platform showcasing PartsTech API capabilities
- ✅ Increased transaction volume across your supplier network
- ✅ Competitive positioning vs. Mitchell/CCC's limited networks

**Proof:** Attached is our full technical proposal with platform screenshots, database schema, and integration architecture.

Can we schedule a call this week or next?

Thanks for your consideration!

Best,
[Your Name]
Founder, CollisionPro

P.S. - We've already built the cart optimizer and have a production database ready to sync with PartsTech's API. We can be integrated and driving transactions within 2 weeks of getting credentials.
