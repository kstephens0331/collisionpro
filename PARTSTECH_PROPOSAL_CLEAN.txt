PARTSTECH API INTEGRATION PROPOSAL - COLLISIONPRO

Date: January 15, 2025
To: PartsTech Sales & Business Development
From: CollisionPro Development Team
Subject: Enterprise Integration Partnership Request

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

CollisionPro is building the largest collision parts pricing database in the industry with a revolutionary multi-supplier optimization engine that automatically finds the lowest-cost parts configuration across all available suppliers while optimizing for shipping costs and delivery times.

We believe PartsTech's network of 20,000+ suppliers and 6M+ parts catalog is the perfect foundation for this vision, and we're seeking an API integration partnership.

WHY COLLISIONPRO NEEDS PARTSTECH

1. Scale Beyond Current Market Leaders

Current Industry Standards:
- Mitchell International: ~10 major suppliers
- CCC ONE: ~15 major suppliers
- Audatex: ~12 major suppliers

CollisionPro's Vision:
- 20,000+ suppliers through PartsTech
- Real-time pricing across entire network
- Smart optimization for best total cost

PartsTech's aggregation eliminates the need to build individual integrations with each supplier, allowing us to offer unprecedented supplier coverage from day one.

2. Technical Architecture Requires Real-Time Data

Our Smart Cart Optimizer Algorithm:

CollisionPro's core differentiator is an intelligent cart optimization engine that:

1. Analyzes all parts in a repair estimate (typically 5-20 parts per job)
2. Queries pricing from all available suppliers (via PartsTech API)
3. Calculates total cost including shipping for every possible supplier combination
4. Optimizes order splitting across multiple suppliers to minimize total cost

Example:
Repair requires: 7 parts totaling $850 from single supplier

Smart Optimizer finds:
- 2 parts from O'Reilly ($180) - Free shipping over $50
- 1 part from AutoZone ($75) - Free shipping over $35
- 4 parts from RockAuto ($495) - $12.50 shipping

Total: $762.50 (saving $87.50 / 10.3%)

This requires:
- Real-time pricing across all suppliers
- Accurate inventory availability
- Shipping cost calculations per supplier
- Vehicle compatibility verification

PartsTech's API is the only solution that provides this data at the scale we need.

3. Professional Market Positioning

Target Customers:
- Independent collision repair shops (5,000+ potential customers)
- Multi-location collision chains (500+ potential customers)
- Insurance adjusters seeking competitive pricing verification

Current Traction:
- Production web application deployed (collisionpro.vercel.app)
- Multi-tenant architecture supporting unlimited shops
- Role-based access control (shop owners, estimators, parts managers)
- PostgreSQL database with 15+ tables for estimating workflow
- Smart cart optimizer with shipping calculation engine
- Real-time pricing UI with auto-refresh every 10 seconds

Revenue Model:
- SaaS subscription: $99-299/month per shop
- Transaction fees: 1-2% of parts ordered through platform
- Enterprise licensing: Custom pricing for chains

PartsTech Benefits:
- Increased API usage from growing shop network
- Revenue share on parts transactions
- Exposure to shops not currently using PartsTech

APPENDIX: TECHNICAL PROOF OF CONCEPT

Smart Cart Optimizer Example (Built & Tested):

Input: 7 parts for 2020 Honda Civic repair

Naive approach (single supplier):
- All 7 parts from NAPA: $847.93 + $0 shipping = $847.93

Smart optimizer result:

Order 1 - AutoZone (2 parts):
  - Front Bumper Cover: $215.99
  - Headlight Assembly: $89.99
  - Subtotal: $305.98 (free shipping over $35)

Order 2 - RockAuto (4 parts):
  - Hood: $185.50
  - Fender (left): $145.00
  - Grille: $67.99
  - Fog Light: $42.50
  - Subtotal: $440.99 + $11.25 shipping = $452.24

Order 3 - O'Reilly (1 part):
  - Mirror Assembly: $78.99 (free shipping over $50)

Total: $837.21
Savings: $10.72 (1.3%)

With PartsTech (20,000 suppliers):
Estimated savings: 5-15% per repair
Average shop: 50 repairs/month × $850/repair × 10% = $4,250/month saved

This is the future of collision estimating.
