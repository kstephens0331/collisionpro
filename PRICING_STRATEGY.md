## 📊 REVENUE PROJECTIONS

### Conservative Growth Model:

**Year 1:**

- Assume 20% referral discount: $60K MRR = $720K ARR

**Year 2:**
- 500 shops × $750/month = $375K MRR = $4.5M ARR
- Assume 20% referral discount: $300K MRR = $3.6M ARR

**Year 3:**
- 2,000 shops × $750/month = $1.5M MRR = $18M ARR
- Assume 20% referral discount: $1.2M MRR = $14.4M ARR

### With Founding Member Pricing (first 100):
**Year 1:**
- 100 shops × $500/month = $50K MRR = $600K ARR

**Year 2:**
- 100 founding × $500 = $50K
- 400 regular × $600 (avg w/ referrals) = $240K
- **Total: $290K MRR = $3.48M ARR**

**Year 3:**
- 100 founding × $500 = $50K

## 🎤 SALES SCRIPT

### Discovery Call:

**"What are you currently using?"**
- CCC ONE/Mitchell: "How much are you paying? $1,200/month? What if I could cut that in half?"
- Nothing: "How are you tracking repairs? Excel? That's costing you money."

**"Do you use QuickBooks?"**
- Yes: "We replace that too. Save another $80/month."
- No: "How do you track your books? That's a mess. We fix that."

**"How many estimates per month?"**
- Calculate time saved:
  - 50 estimates/month × 30 min saved = 25 hours
  - 25 hours × $50/hour = $1,250/month value
  - "We pay for ourselves in time savings alone."

**"What if you could try it free for 30 days?"**
- No risk
- No credit card
- See the difference yourself

**"Plus, refer another shop and you both get $50/month off."**
- Built-in incentive
- "Help a buddy save money too"
